* I liked how the discussions were also split into multiple videos.
The discussions were asynchronous, and with the professor, and thus no interaction was with the TAs.
* Li helped me on understanding concepts in this class very well. I always sent email to Li asking about
certain parts that I was confused about and Li always replied to me and clarified them for me. Thank
you Li!
* Strength: support students in developing code
Weakness: only 3 students attended each week
* Very knowledgeable on the topic and discussions were extremely helpful!
* discussions were effective.
* He was clear in what he wanted, his presentations, through sometimes were a little confusing, were
structured, and well thought out. I do not think that I could have done this well in this class if not for him.
* He was knowledgeable and clear, and very helpful in all his discussions. I did not miss a single one, and
I think he helped tremendously.
* The Lab was so helpful for better understanding the assignments.
* Very good at explaining the concepts and ideas behind the code. It was also very helpful that we started
going over the project early on.
* labs were effective.
